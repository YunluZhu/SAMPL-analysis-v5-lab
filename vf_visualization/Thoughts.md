## speed -> timing of steering

window of parameter definition may need to be changed. dynamic definition for parameters based on bout speed?

- faster bouts shows less rotation during acceleration but more during pre bout
- slower bouts shows more rotation during acceleration but less during pre bout
- similar can be seen in correlation of acceleration and deceleration, or initial rotation vs deceleration rotation

## what tau is doing

- for pitch, neg more neg, pos more pos.
    look at kde distribution with UD separated
- indicating under detection and over correction?
- come with a parameter for tau effectness on balance?
- parameters seen more robust changes: initial pitch, peak pitch, rot-late-accel, rot-decel

## reason for the dip
