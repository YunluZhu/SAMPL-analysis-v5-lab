# SAMPL Analysis and Visualization

This code is for analysis and visualization of data generated using free-swimming apparatus. 

The VF analysis package reads LabView .dlm files generated by free swimming vertical fish apparatus (preprocessing), extracts and analyzes bouts (bout_analysis), and makes figures (visualization).

Run `SAMPL_analysis/SAMPL_analysis_....py` to analyze .dlm files. Then, run individual visualization scripts under `SAMPL_visualization/` to make figures. See below for detailed instructions.

## Release notes

**v5.0.230111**

1. Speed threshold changed to 5 mm/s
2. Fixed a bug in analysis that randomly excluds ~half of the data
3. Increased max angular velocity threshold from 100 to 250
4. Saving all_data.h5 is now optional

*Re-analyze your data is highly recommended*

**v4.1.220610**

1. Shortened aligned bout duration
2. Added arrangement scripts
3. Visualization code streamlined. Added functions to get features and kinetics
4. New Fin-Body algorithm
5. Visualization code now takes zeitgeber time (ztime) as a second input (other than `root`). Legal inputs are: `'day'`, `'night'`, and `'all'`.

**v4.3.220826**

1. Fixed a filter error on angular acceleration in analyze_dlm_v4.py. Now yields 50-80% more bouts
2. Added logging function. One log file will be generated the first time you run the ana code and will be updated every time you analyze a dataset.
3. Added the ability to skip dlm with no alignable bouts. With this version, to prevent error during ana process, just search under the root folder for “dlm”, delete any dlm file that are <1MB. Then you are safe to run the ana code.
4. Metadata handling updated. Can read ini files directly in the grab_fish_angle script and export metadata as a csv in parent folder
5. New visualization scripts.

**v4.4 221013**

1. Parameters redefined. See parameter table below for details
2. Fixed bug in `get_bout_features()` `get_bout_kinetics()` `get_IBIangles()` causing oversampling of bouts

**To dos**

- change condition names to cond1 and cond1 from dpf/condition
- clean up visualization scripts
- include option to turn off Jackknife sampling for visualization scripts
- include new visualization for lift gain

**Known issues**

- analysis code can deal with .dlm with no bouts mostly. However, bout check has not been implemented to every single quality control filters, which means, though very unlikely, you may still get an error if there's no alignable bout. In another senario, if you have data that ends up giving 1 aligned bouts, analysis code will throw an error when it's trying to calculate the mean values.

## Usage

### Contents

`docs` contains a copy of catalog files generated after running `.../SAMPL_analysis/SAMPL_analysis.py`

`docs/SAMPL_analysis_visualization_paper` contains complete code for the SAMPL mechod manuscript that should work out of the box.

`SAMPL_analysis` folder contains all the scripts for data analysis.

`SAMPL_visualization` includes all scripts for plotting.

`SAMPL_dataARR` contains code for raw data arrangement. These scripts read metadata files (.ini) and arrange raw data collected from multiple boxes into organized structure (see Data arrangement section below). Arrangement scripts are specific to the experiments so you may want to write your own code that works for your experimental conditions.

### Data arrangement

1. Organize .dlm files. Each folder with .dlm files will be recognized as one "experiment (exp)" during jackknife analysis. Therefore, if you want to combine all data from a certain clutch, put them into the same folder. See below for a sample structure. For the folders representing experimental conditions, 2 conditions separated by "_" are taken as inputs. e.g. `cond1_cond1`. For consistency, it is recommended to use `cond1` for the age of the fish and/or light-dark condition and mark the experimental condition using `cond1`.
2. However, for the analysis code to work, your data doesn't have to be in this structure. `SAMPL_analysis/SAMPL_analysis....py` looks for all .dlm under the directory and subfolders in the directory the user specifies. Therefore, it can be used to analyze data generated from a single experiment by giving it (in the example below) `root/7dd_ctrl/200607 ***` as the root directory. Again, all .dlm files under the same folder will be combined for analysis, if you want to treat them as different "conditions", move them into different parent folders and name the parent folders as described above.
3. It is recommended to wirte an arrangement code that reads metadata files (.ini) and organizes your .dlm data instead of moving files manually. See `SAMPL_dataARR` for some sample scripts.
4. For Jackknife resampling to work properly, make sure the exp folders under each conditions can be sorted in the same alphabetical order. In the example below, (if intended to compare against each other,) experiment folders in `7dd_ctrl` correspond with those under `7dd_condition`. Folder names for experiment folders under each conditions don't need to be the same but should be in the same alphabetical order. If multiple repeats (experiment folders) are generated in a single day, one may name the experiment folders as `exp1`, `exp2` etc.

```

### Analyze raw data files

To analyze data generated using the free-swimming apparatus:

1. Run `SAMPL_analysis/SAMPL_analysis....py`.
2. Follow the instruction and input the root path that contains data files (.dlm) and corresponding metadata files (.ini). Data can be directly under the root directory or under subfolders within the root directory. See notes for details.
3. Follow the instruction and input the frame rate (in integer), and decide whether to save all epoch data that passes quality control (y/n). See notes for details.
4. The program will go through every data file in each subfolder (if there is any) and extract swim attributes.

When finished, there will be three hdf5 files (.h5) under each directory that contains data file(s) together with catalog files that explains the parameters extracted. A copy of catalog files can be found under `docs`.
If saving epoch data is disabled, an EMPTY all_data.h5 will be saved (or overwrite previously generated all_data.h5). Saving epoch data significantly increases file size. It is recommended not to do so for most of the datasets and only re-analyze those that you need epoch data.

All the extracted swim bouts under `bout_data.h5` are aligned at the time of the peak speed. Each aligned bout contains swim parameters from 500 ms before to 300 ms after the time of the peak speed.

**Notes** on data analysis

- All the .dlm data files under the same directory will be combined for bout extraction. To analyze data separately, please move data files (.dlm) and corresponding metadata files (.ini) into subfolders under the root path.
- Analysis program will stop if it fails to detect any swim bout in a data file (.dlm). To avoid this, please make sure all data files to be analyzed are reasonably large so that it contains at least one swim bout. Generally, we found > 10 MB being a good criteria.
- Please input the correct frame rate as this affects calculation of parameters. This program only accepts one frame rate number for each run. Therefore, all data files under the root path need to be acquired under the same frame rate.

### Make figures

1. **IMPORTANT** update `SAMPL_visualization/plot_functions/get_data_dir.py` to specify the names of your datasets and the directory of it. `get_data_dir(pick_data)` is called by every *visualization script*. Therefore, instead of typing directories for different datasets to plot everytime, specifying the name of your dataset in *visualization scripts* `pick_data = '<NAME OF YOUR DATASET>'` tells the script which data to plot. Also update the `get_figure_dir()` function in `get_data_dir.py`. This should be the root folder to save all plotted figures. Subfolders named by the name of your datadsets (input to `pick_data`) will be created under your `get_figure_dir(pick_data)` directory.
2. Run individual scripts under `SAMPL_visualization/`.
    - each visualization script takes a root directory including all analyzed data, which should be same as the one fed to the analysis code. Visualization scripts calls `get_data_dir.py` to look for data directories.
    - all visualization scripts get experimental conditions and age info from folder names
    - jackknife is used for resampling in some scripts

**Visualization scripts and function** explained

1. Plot bout time series data

## Guides

### On analysis

1. Data analysis takes time. Since the script goes through all the subfolders under root directory, be smart with the root input. There's no need to re-analyze the dataset if the .dlm files haven't been changed. In another word, if you've added new .dlm files into an analyzed folder containing old .dlm files, make sure to re-analyze this folder.
2. Always take the .ini metadata file when moving .dlm around or generate a metadata table containing experiment info for all the .dlm files.

### On plotting

1. Conditions (`cond0` `cond1`) are taken from parent folder names and sorted alphabetically. If you want them to be in a specific order, the easiest way to do is to add number before each condition, e.g.: `07dpf_1ctrl` `07dpf_2cond`.
2. Some scripts only compare data with different `cond1`, feel free to edit the scripts and make the comparison across other conditions.
3. Bouts are separated into "nose-up" and "nose-down" bouts based on their initial pitch. The cut point is at a fixed 10 deg for all the ages/conditions. This is generally true across all the dataset I've look at. An alternative way is to calculate the set point for each condition and split bouts by their set points. This can be easily done by `groupby(['conditions', 'age', 'repeats', 'whatever']).apply(get_kinetics())` or looping through every sub-condition to apply `pd.cut()`.

### On data interpretation

1. Take any results based on <1000 bouts with a grain of salt. Some parameters (such as bout timing parabola fit and righting gain) require a large number of bouts (>5000) to start to converge.  
2. Always look at the time series plots first. Strong phenotypes can be seen on averaged time series results.
3. Then, look at distributions of parameters.
4. `Inter-bout interval pitch` shows posture/stability of fish. The timing parabola fit tells you their "preferred" posture, baseline bout rate (which can also be seen in IEI distribution plots), and sensitivity to posture changes.
5. Kinetics tells you how fish coordinate propulsion and rotation in general. `fin_body` and `steering gain` demonstrate fin engagement.
6. Lastly, check bout features (`Bfeatures_features` and `Bfeatures_4_by...`). Any subtle differences in the way fish swims can be picked up here. However, Jackknife resampling may "exaggerate" differences across fish with different backgrounds, so pay attention to the y-axis range.
